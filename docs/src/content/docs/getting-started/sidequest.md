title: Sidequest
description: Plan, track, and deliver Claude Code work from a local board.
---

Sidequest gives Claude Code a local board for planned work. It groups tickets into stories, keeps the backlog visible, and runs delegated work through a repeatable review and delivery flow. That flow works for Git codebases and filesystem snapshots of non-Git documentation trees, vaults, and research collections.

## Install

Install Sidequest for the project you are working in:

```text
/plugin marketplace add Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed
/plugin install sidequest@eigenwise-toolshed --scope project
```

Reload Claude Code or start a new session after installing. Sidequest packages its executor roster with the plugin, so Claude discovers every routed executor when it loads the plugin, before SessionStart maintenance. You can also run `/quartermaster:setup` and let Quartermaster install and configure Sidequest for the project.

Sidequest is local. The dashboard runs on your machine and ticket data stays in the local Sidequest store.

## Your first workflow

1. Open the board with `/sidequest:board`, or tell Claude to show your Sidequest board.
2. Describe the outcome you want and ask Claude to plan it as Sidequest work. For example: `Plan the checkout refresh as a Sidequest story and show me the backlog.` If work belongs on a feature branch, name that branch in the request.
3. Review the proposed tickets, dependencies, and scope in the board. Adjust the plan before work starts.
4. Ask Claude to dispatch the ready tickets. Claude chooses the configured route, starts the work, and reports verification results. Dispatch freezes each ticket's intended target branch, so two concurrent feature branches get separate targets without changing the board default. Integration keeps that recorded target through submission and delivery; a group with different targets stops before changing either branch.
5. When a ticket is ready, ask Claude to review and integrate it if the checks pass. Larger or higher-risk work may need an extra review before integration.

Each ticket carries a focused check that decides whether its work is ready. Claude records that check against
the final candidate and reports what passed, failed, or needs your decision. After integration, Claude runs
one combined full gate for the assembled work. The agent-facing reference covers capture, evidence, and
delivery mechanics.

Integration always happens in your local checkout: Claude merges the work into the local target branch and
runs the check there. Sidequest never fetches and never pushes, so the push stays a deliberate step you or
Claude take afterwards. When the project has an `origin` remote, Sidequest additionally reads
`origin/<branch>` as evidence about what already landed, which is how it recognizes work that someone merged
outside the board. That only affects what counts as proof; the merge and the check still run locally, and a
recorded delivery always names the branch that actually carried it.

### Choose the planning depth

Use the lightest planning that fits. Exact small changes and operational asks can stay lightweight. Substantial or ambiguous work starts with a visible surgical contract: the outcome, non-goals, smallest authority needed, scope, bounded oracle (the check that decides whether it worked), and review limit. Claude settles why an improvement is worth making, its approach, and its boundary before dispatch. Research can supply facts and bounded alternatives. Executors implement that plan with normal local coding judgment and report evidence when a pinned choice cannot work.

Claude lists what the request leaves unclear, sends the unknowns the code can answer to parallel read-only sub-agents, and asks one batched question round only for what that investigation could not settle, with the findings attached to each question. If the approach is genuinely contested, it may offer bounded agent proposals instead. `Do your thing`, `use your judgment`, and similar phrases delegate decisions for the current feature or story, not for future work.

Review stays tied to the pinned contract. If two candidate fixes are rejected in the same defect chain, stop patching and replan before trying another candidate. A bound review and its source cannot be deleted, even with force. Keep the record and create a fresh independently reviewed replacement when needed; deletion does not repair older orphaned records.

The board keeps the work visible while Claude and its executors handle the ticket lifecycle. A Git ticket submits a verified range; a non-Git ticket submits a verified project snapshot. Claude reports any unavailable capability or failed delivery instead of guessing around it.

## Use the dashboard

The project rail keeps every registered board in one place, with ticket counts and status progress beside each project. The combined view is useful when you want to scan ownership, priorities, labels, stories, and routes across the whole queue.

![Sidequest dashboard with three synthetic projects and populated todo, doing, and done columns](../../../assets/screenshots/sidequest-kanban.png)

*Synthetic demo data showing three active project boards and 25 tickets.*

Select a project in the rail when you need its focused board. The columns keep that project's open and completed work visible without losing the rest of the rail.

![Acme Fulfillment synthetic board selected in the Sidequest project rail](../../../assets/screenshots/sidequest-second-project.png)

*Synthetic demo data showing nine active Fulfillment tickets across todo, doing, and done.*

The toolbar searches refs, titles, and labels, then combines that query with priority, story, assignee, and sort controls. Active filters stay visible, so you can tell why a card is in the result.

*Synthetic demo data showing six mobile tickets narrowed to normal priority.*

The inbox collects comments, reminders, ticket creation, and status activity across projects. Its tabs separate work that needs you from the wider activity stream.

![Sidequest notification inbox open over a populated synthetic board](../../../assets/screenshots/sidequest-notifications.png)

*Synthetic demo data showing several unread comment notifications from different tickets.*

Open a ticket to edit its fields and read the working context in one place. The detail view keeps a scheduled reminder, dependency links, and the full comment thread beside the ticket fields.

*Synthetic demo data showing the Build cart summary ticket and its team discussion.*

Stories group tickets into a plan you can filter and discuss before dispatch. The toolbar story filter keeps the story list visible while you scan the combined board.

![Sidequest story filter showing synthetic stories across the combined board](../../../assets/screenshots/sidequest-stories.png)

*Synthetic demo data showing the Checkout confidence, Storefront discovery, and fulfillment story groups.*

Links show which tickets block or relate to each other. Use the dependency list to inspect the existing chain, then choose a link type and target when you add another relationship.

![Sidequest ticket links editor showing two populated dependency relationships and the add-link controls](../../../assets/screenshots/sidequest-ticket-links.png)

*Synthetic demo data showing the existing and newly added dependencies for the Build cart summary ticket.*

The lower ticket context keeps declared files, attachment previews, and the full discussion visible without putting the link picker over the comments.

*Synthetic demo data showing the declared checkout files, visual references, and team decisions attached to the same ticket.*

Completed work can move into the archive without disappearing. The archive view keeps the source board, priority, age, and restore action with each ticket.

Settings covers routing profiles, model fallback, theme, notification preferences, and the guided tour. Open it when you need to change how the board behaves rather than the work on a ticket.

## Daily use

Ask Claude to do the board work in plain language:

- `Show me the Sidequest backlog for this project.`
- `What is ready to dispatch for the checkout story?`
- `Add a ticket for the empty-state bug and include the reproduction steps.`
- `What is blocking the checkout ticket?`
- `Review and integrate the checkout ticket if its verification passed.`

For substantial changes, Claude can turn the request into a story with linked tickets so you can see the whole plan before execution. Side issues that come up during a session can become separate tickets instead of disappearing into the current task.

Sidequest keeps ticket activity visible in the board. Ask Claude to check active work after a restart or when you need help with a ticket that was started in another session.

CI watch alerts exclude completed runs marked `skipped` or `neutral`. Neither conclusion proves that the required checks passed; release verification still needs successful checks on the exact commit.

### Boards in sibling repositories

If you run one session from a parent directory holding several independent repos, each registered as its own board, an executor working a sibling repo's ticket no longer has to name the board on the calls that carry its `worktree` (commit, submit, checkpoint, dispatch). Sidequest resolves the board from the executor's own binding: the ticket ref plus the worktree its dispatch reserved for it, or, for a shared-tree dispatch, the ref plus the claim owner. Calls without a `worktree` argument (comment, release, done, claim, plan, scope requests) still need `project` to reach the sibling board. Nothing else selects a board, so a caller without a claim stays on the session's own board and gets that board's usual refusal. Passing `project` explicitly still wins, and two boards that both fit the same binding are refused by name rather than picked for you.

## Read-only reports

Use Sidequest for independent candidate reviews, repository audits, and shortcut debt scans. They use the existing read-only review route and only report findings.

An explicit per-ticket route can use a different provider when the ticket is effectively readonly. It leaves the category route alone; writable tickets and automatic fallbacks stay with their provider.

- A candidate review starts from the submitted ticket and its immutable candidate, never a working tree. Ask Claude to bind the review to that submission.
- A repository audit names the directory or subsystem to inspect. It reports concrete delete, reuse, standard-library, native-platform, YAGNI, and shrinking opportunities with source locations. It does not edit code.
- A shortcut debt scan reads source comments, including `whittle:` markers. Each result gives the file and line, known ceiling, observable upgrade trigger, and replacement. A missing ceiling or trigger remains a finding.

These read-only reports work independently. If Sidequest is not installed in the host, Claude reports that the routed capability is unavailable. Observability can show absolute measurements, though gain stays unmeasured without a matched baseline. Static headline figures and private workflow data do not prove a gain.

## If something stops working

**The board does not open.** Reload Claude Code after installing Sidequest, then ask Claude to open the board again. If the browser still does not open, ask Claude to start the Sidequest dashboard and report its local URL.

**Claude reports an older loaded Sidequest after an upgrade.** Reload plugins or start a new session to pick up the current connection and packaged executor roster. Unknown versions, schema changes, and incompatible older loaded versions refuse dispatch until reload.

**Claude says an executor is missing.** Update Sidequest, reload plugins in the affected session, and ask Claude to dispatch again. Do not create replacement agents or disable the dispatch guard.

**Claude's Agent tool rejects `name` or `mode`.** Ask Claude to inspect the Agent schema it can see, then use Sidequest's reduced-schema dispatch only when those two fields are absent. Sidequest keeps the board label separately and refuses the first claim unless the host hook reports the real agent identity and a permission mode the executor can actually finish under, which is `auto` or `bypassPermissions`. A reduced-schema executor inherits the mode of the session that spawned it, so this is a fact about your host, not a setting to change: if it reports something else, use a host that reports one of those two instead of adding unsupported fields or editing your permissions.

**A ticket will not dispatch.** Ask Claude to diagnose the ticket. Common causes are an incomplete work description, a blocked dependency, or an unavailable configured route. Claude reports the specific recovery instead of silently changing the work's route. A refused dispatch leaves the ticket's current token working, so the executor that already holds it keeps running: Sidequest only replaces the token once the new dispatch is saved. For a non-Git project it also captures the filesystem snapshot before the final checks, and a project registration change rejects that capture rather than recording it. That snapshot is bounded by a path count, a byte total, and a wall clock, and it refuses with the limit it hit instead of hanging. A deadline refusal names the file it was reading when the clock ran out, which is the whole diagnostic when a sync client or network share is the thing blocking. A third dispatch after two durable terminal no-commit rounds is blocked by default, on the theory that an unreadable environment reproduces the same failure every time; overriding it takes an explicit `allowRepeatFailure` (CLI `--allow-repeat-failure`), and taking that override is recorded on the ticket.

**A legitimate recursive delete gets refused.** Sidequest blocks a Bash or PowerShell command that recursively deletes the user profile or the `.claude` root, even inside a real cleanup. Point the delete at a specific project or scratchpad path instead.

**A read-only ticket cannot start in a new repository.** Claude reports the checkout choice and keeps the ticket read-only. You do not need to commit notes or change board settings.

**A worktree-isolated executor cannot write.** Ask Claude to redispatch if the recorded checkout is missing or does not match the assigned checkout.

**A ticket's project is a different repository from the current session.** An isolated dispatch now cuts its own worktree from the ticket's project and verifies there, not from the session's checkout, so this works across repositories. It only refuses when the same session already has isolated dispatches open on two different projects at once; that case names the conflict and the remedy.

**Work looks stuck in doing.** Ask Claude to inspect the ticket's current status and executor activity. Sidequest keeps the intended integration branch that was frozen at dispatch, even if you later change branches or the board default. For two feature branches, name the intended target on each ticket instead of changing that board-wide default between dispatches. A read-only ticket in an isolated worktree also honors an explicit board base of `local-main` or `origin-main`; the automatic base deliberately stays on the checkout that prepared it. A bound review still starts from its candidate commit.

**A ticketed helper is refused while writing verification evidence.** Only the ticket's active owner and helpers admitted through that owner's recorded identity can write the ticket's exact board-owned evidence directory. Helpers cannot use another ticket's folder or a lookalike path. Ask Claude to inspect the ticket binding, not to request repository scope.

**Stale agent worktrees keep accumulating.** Ask Claude to inspect local worktree storage and clean up entries it can safely remove. Storage is reported per directory with a total, so a directory quietly growing to tens of gigabytes is visible. A manual sweep reports each candidate while it classifies it, including its count and skip reason, and can walk every registered project in one run instead of only the one you have open. Cleanup classifies in this order: `status_unknown` keeps; `tracked_changes` keeps; `too_young` keeps for 3 hours; `upstream_ambiguous` or `upstream_unavailable` keeps; `untracked_recent` keeps, while `untracked_quarantined` moves a tree holding untracked or ignored content older than 7 days whole into quarantine; `ticket_archived`, `ticket_done`, `branch_reachable`, and `patch_equivalent` remove; `commits_on_branch` removes the tree and retains its branch; `not_integrated_salvage` salvages work older than 7 days; then `not_integrated` keeps. Quarantined work is parked for 14 days and removed on age alone; nothing younger is ever deleted, and entries under a live claim are kept. Nothing is deleted where it stands: a reclaimed tree is renamed into quarantine, and content that was there when the sweep classified it, or that arrives before the move, parks the whole tree. A tree counts as clean only when its status carries nothing untracked or ignored (ignored content counts, including a gitignored nested repository; the one exception is installed files under an ignored `node_modules`, which worktree setup regenerates); anything else stays in quarantine. The moved copy is re-read once before its files are deleted, so a file written into it in the instant after that read is deleted with it. A commit on the worktree's own branch is not lost: the branch is deleted only with `update-ref -d refs/heads/<branch> <tip>` against the tip re-read at that destination, so a commit landed on it after that read leaves the branch retained as `tip_moved`. That compare is by value, so a ref moved away and then back to the same tip is not detected. A detached checkout is never reclaimed on ticket status alone: before its tree is touched, and again at the quarantine destination, the sweep asks the main checkout whether another ref already contains that HEAD, counting neither the checkout's own private metadata, nor a per-worktree ref (`refs/worktree/`, `refs/bisect/`, `refs/rewritten/`) of the checkout doing the asking, nor any branch this sweep could still delete, which includes every `worktree-agent` branch the orphan pass may take once the reclaims are done; a probe that cannot answer keeps the tree, and so does a branch listing it cannot read. A HEAD no other ref holds keeps its checkout where it stands as `detached_head_unpinned`, and one whose ref disappears mid-reclaim parks the moved tree: the park runs `git worktree repair` against the quarantine destination, so the parked tree keeps a working HEAD and its commit stays in `rev-list --all` after the prune. A repair that cannot be confirmed withholds every repository prune until a later sweep repairs every retained park, and is reported as a failure, leaving both the files and the registration they came from intact. Expiry removes quarantine files with link-safe filesystem deletion; only after retained parks reconcile does Git's metadata-only prune remove their registrations, otherwise that metadata cleanup is reported as deferred. A review's detached checkout still reclaims normally, because its candidate is pinned by `refs/sidequest/<ref>`. The limit is a commit made on a detached HEAD after those reads. On Windows a process still holding the tree open makes the rename fail and the tree stays in place until a later pass, and quarantine lives under the Sidequest home, so a worktree on a different volume is never reclaimed and parks as `quarantine_failed` every pass until the quarantine directory is on the same volume. The move itself never follows a dependency link, and the links it carried are released at the quarantine destination afterwards, which never deletes what they point at. Every delivery path reclaims the candidate worktree in the same command, at zero age: `sidequest integrate`, `groom-close --integration`, and the MCP integrate and groomClose tools. The generated reference has the lifecycle and recovery details.

**A ticket contract forbids commits.** Ask Claude to declare working-tree delivery before dispatch. Command and suite requirements close after the matching final capture. Commandless document, link, schema, custom, manual, and attestation requirements close with explicit typed evidence. The declared edits stay uncommitted and unpushed in the shared checkout for your normal team handoff. Ticket closure records that handoff; it does not replace your project's commit, review, or push process. A sibling's active allocation is ignored only when both dispatches record the same nonempty preparing session, their claims overlap, and their scopes are disjoint. Before dirty-path classification, Sidequest validates every eligible completed sibling's recorded candidate against its recorded paths and current content. A mismatch stops closeout, so preserve the shared-tree work and hand it back to the existing parent for verification or grooming. Do not revert it or expand scope to absorb it.

**A POSIX verify command fails on Windows.** Ask Claude to inspect the recorded verification result and the shell it used.

**Verification fails before any edit.** The active claim holder can record `[sidequest:verify-complete] failed: <evidence>` or `[sidequest:verify-complete] could_not_run: <evidence>` before touching the repository. That preserves the failure report only. A passing completion, submit, or done still needs the declared scoped work and required verification.

**A delivered ticket's verify command no longer runs.** Ask Claude to record a passing replacement verifier; Sidequest keeps the original requirement and its evidence on the ticket alongside the replacement.

**A submitted ticket is not integrated.** Ask Claude to inspect the submission and complete the review and integration step. Do not start the same ticket again while a submitted result is waiting.

**A wave left out submitted work.** Ask Claude to inspect the assembled wave and its declared participant set. Active or accepted pending candidates with overlapping scope belong in the wave. Review-rejected candidates stay visible for later supersession and do not block an accepted repair wave.

**Overlapping candidates use different pinned checks.** Claude keeps the checks and candidate identities frozen, composes the exact accepted candidates in the registered target, runs every pinned check and the full composed gate, then records each verified delivery manually. This is a control-plane `groomClose` with the immutable candidate as `deliveryCommit` and `deliveryMethod: "manual"`, without `integration: true`, which is only for a matching delivered wave. Missing candidate content, a skipped review or check, and substituting current `HEAD` all refuse.

**A repair was delivered with `apply`, and closing the rejected submission it replaces keeps refusing.** `apply` puts the delivered changes in your working tree instead of a commit, so the board has no committed tree to prove the replaced paths against. Commit that tree unchanged on the recorded target branch, then ask Claude to bind it: a `groomClose` on the already-closed repair with that commit as `deliveryCommit`. Sidequest re-runs the merged-tree check and refuses a commit that is unreachable from the target or whose tree differs from the reviewed candidate on any submitted path. A refusal, including a failing check, leaves the recorded delivery alone, so the same commit can be bound again once the cause is fixed. After that, superseding the rejected submission needs replacement evidence only for the paths the repair really changed. Do not claim untouched paths as replacements to get past the refusal.

**A candidate was rebased or squash-merged before it landed.** Its files no longer match the candidate byte for byte, and later merges keep moving them, so a plain manual delivery refuses for missing content. Ask Claude to record the delivery against the landed revision it can name — a merge commit, or whatever the upstream flow produced — and Sidequest proves every submitted path at that revision instead of your working tree: the same content, a deletion the revision also carries, or the candidate's own change reverse-applying onto it. Anything left over still refuses, and closes only once Claude names those paths as resolved by hand and the closure reason carries that evidence. A revision older than the candidate's own starting point is refused outright, because it cannot hold the landing, and naming resolved paths on a candidate the branch already contains is refused too rather than quietly ignored. The record keeps the per-path proof.

**A verdict on a bound review approved the candidate, but you meant to agree the reviewer was right to reject it.** A verdict's outcome always describes the candidate, not the reviewer's prose: `accepted` approves the candidate, `rejected` confirms it must not ship. A finalized `accepted` cannot be reversed by another verdict, and there is no recovery path for a mistaken accept. To reject a candidate a reviewer flagged, record the verdict as `rejected`.

**Integration stops because the work already landed on the remote.** Your local target branch is behind a commit that already contains the candidate, usually because someone merged it outside the board. Sidequest refuses instead of merging, and it does not move your branch, fetch, or run the check. For a group, it checks every participant before touching anything, so nothing is half delivered. Fetch and bring the local branch forward yourself, then ask Claude to retry the closure.

**A submission sat so long it can no longer be integrated.** Ask Claude to check whether the requested behavior already reached the intended branch. If it did, Claude records that evidence; if it did not, the work needs a fresh ticket against current source.
