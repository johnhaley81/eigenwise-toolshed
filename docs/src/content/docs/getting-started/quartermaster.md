title: Quartermaster setup
description: Set up workspaces, keep Toolshed plugins current, and find missing capabilities after real work.
---

Quartermaster helps with project setup, Toolshed maintenance, workspace health, and the next capability your work is missing. Its local scripts read transcript files and emit a bounded summary. The active model sees that summary when the setup or resupply skill reads it, not the raw transcripts.

## Install

Install Quartermaster in the project you want to set up. This example uses project scope:

```text
/plugin marketplace add Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed
/plugin install quartermaster@eigenwise-toolshed --scope project
```

Activate it with `/reload-plugins` or start a new Claude Code session.

## Set up a workspace

From the project directory, run:

> /quartermaster:setup

Setup reads the project, mines recent session history across your projects, asks a few setup questions, and proposes a plan covering Toolshed plugins, stack plugins, starter rules, and permission entries. You approve each item before it installs or writes anything. Its starter rules teach agents to trace the real flow, question whether new code is needed, and reuse existing code, the standard library, native platform features, or installed dependencies before adding anything. Every workspace gets the clean-code baseline as a live rule. When a change is needed, they favor the smallest shared-root fix, preserve trust, data-loss, security, and accessibility safeguards, use focused regression checks, and leave the full gate to the integration owner.

Before it names a plugin in that plan, setup can check current sources for whether the plugin is still maintained, whether the description in the local catalog has gone stale, and whether something fits better, including something from a marketplace you have not added yet. Those lookups are bounded to the few candidates that would lead to an install, and searches use generic capability terms, so your project names and file paths stay out of the search engine's logs. With `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` turned off, Claude skips the check and labels the proposals unresearched rather than implying they were verified. What it reads informs the proposal; your approval is still what authorizes the install.

### Host capabilities

When work needs a coding-agent feature such as delegation, Quartermaster first identifies the host
from available evidence. It separately checks native support, installed extensions, and tools that are
actually usable in the current session. A working native or live capability needs no duplicate
extension. An installed extension that has not loaded calls for the host's activation step and a live
check, not another install. A local catalog only describes the installations it actually inventories;
it cannot answer what another host has installed.

If the capability is absent, Quartermaster checks the identified host's official extensions and
examples before suitable third-party packages. It labels an example as source material that may need
local adaptation, and only presents an install command when the checked source supplies one that fits
the host. Each installation or configuration change still needs explicit approval, followed by the
host's reload or restart boundary and a live-usability check. Missing host or tool evidence stays
uncertain instead of assuming a Claude Code command or package ecosystem.

For Pi coding agent, the checked upstream [Subagent Example](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent)
launches separate Pi processes and documents linking the extension, agent definitions, and workflow
prompts into Pi configuration directories. That makes it a local-fit example, not a universal
marketplace package. Quartermaster can recommend researching it for a proven delegation gap without
claiming Quartermaster runs on Pi.

Setup installs the approved plugins and writes the approved project files, then pauses at the activation boundary. Run `/reload-plugins`, or restart Claude Code when the change affects the process environment, and tell Claude `continue`. Setup verifies the selected plugins and project configuration after that boundary.

### Keep complex code tested

Setup proposes a CRAP gate for a codebase. CRAP combines a function's branching complexity and test
coverage, so a large function with little coverage gets a high score. The fixed threshold is 6, and
6 fails. It checks every new or modified function, while untouched legacy functions stay out of scope.

When you approve it, setup writes `.claude/quartermaster/crap.json` and a live rule that runs:

```text
node "<quartermaster plugin root>/bin/quartermaster.js" crap
```

The gate measures the Git checkout it runs in, so a linked worktree is measured in place instead of
the main checkout, and a run from a subdirectory still reads the project's `crap.json`. Each run gives
its coverage command a fresh `QUARTERMASTER_COVERAGE_DIR` to write `lcov.info` into, so concurrent runs
on one checkout do not read each other's coverage. A coverage command that exits 0 without writing
fresh coverage exits 2 instead of scoring stale results.

It also shows the coverage command for your stack. The gate needs
[lizard](https://github.com/terryyin/lizard) for complexity measurement. Setup never installs it. Exit
2 means a prerequisite or measurement input is missing, including lizard finding zero functions for a
file that has function-like source tokens. Follow the printed hint, then run the gate again.

When setup wires Model Gateway or Sidequest routing, Quartermaster can offer the optional `325000` `autoCompactWindow` setting for a consistent Codex compaction point. Setup asks before writing it. If user or project settings already has a value, it reports which one wins and preserves that value.

If you choose telemetry, Claude hands the setup to Observability and tells you when a restart is needed. You can also decline and continue without it.

## Keep a workspace current

Tell Claude what you want to do:

> Update my Eigenwise Toolshed plugins.

> Check whether this workspace and its Toolshed plugins are healthy.

Or run the maintenance skills directly:

> /quartermaster:update-toolshed

> /quartermaster:toolshed-doctor

The requested updater reads Claude Code's installed-plugin registry and updates every active Eigenwise Toolshed install at its recorded user, project, or local scope and project path. It can update installs in other recorded projects, not only the project where you invoked it. Third-party plugins and marketplaces are left alone. Before it changes anything, it runs the configured Claude Code command once. The default uses `claude` from `PATH`; if Claude Code is installed elsewhere, retry with `--claude <absolute claude.exe path>`. An unavailable command stops the run before marketplace, plugin, or Model Gateway updates.

Freshness hooks are advisory. They report cached availability and loaded-version mismatches, and they point to `/quartermaster:update-toolshed`; they do not install, restart, or replace the requested updater. Marketplace auto-update is optional and must be enabled for the Eigenwise Toolshed marketplace in Claude Code. An open session still needs `/reload-plugins` after plugin code changes. Restart Claude Code when process-level gateway wiring or model discovery changed.

The health check is read-only. It identifies stale installs, dead `enabledPlugins` entries, and Model Gateway startup-check results when that plugin is present. It also reports managed Observability storage limits without running a repair. Run the updater when you want installs changed.

## The in-the-moment loop

Quartermaster's SessionStart hook can flag a repeated task that may belong in a skill, codebase-map entry, rule, or measurement. It offers to capture the improvement when it notices one; otherwise it stays silent. Setup also re-grounds unchanged rules and surfaces changed matching rules on the next prompt or edit.

## Resupply an existing workspace

After real work has accumulated, run it directly or accept Quartermaster's offer of a focused resupply round:

> /quartermaster:resupply

The miner reads local transcript files and emits a bounded aggregate. The active model can see the aggregate, which may include:

- session titles clipped to 120 characters;
- opening asks clipped to 240 characters;
- explicit goals, whether each goal was met, and bounded goal samples;
- the two directory segments nearest touched files, with scratch and opaque paths removed;
- counts for prompts, tool calls, errors, denials, interrupts, and corrections;
- a denial meaning that identifies `permission-rule` as a host-reported policy block, not proof of
  whether a permission rule or PreToolUse hook blocked the call;
- repeated command names, plugin, skill, and MCP attribution, and fetched hostnames; and
- short user-correction or denial evidence quotes clipped to 300 characters; leading harness blocks are excluded from correction evidence.

Raw transcript files are never loaded into model context, and the resupply skill is forbidden from opening them. The default pass mines the current project. Setup explicitly requests the all-projects summary, while resupply only uses `--all-projects` for a global pass. A host policy label alone never justifies a permission allowlist or hook change; existing approval requirements still apply.

Automatic permission learning stays off until the project opts in with `enable-auto-allowlist`; until then, resupply only reports what it would add. It only considers a fingerprint approved at least three times with no denial, and it never covers a destructive command such as `rm` or `git push --force`. It also excludes bare `PowerShell` rules as too broad, and it does not create scoped PowerShell rules or remove older bare `PowerShell` entries, which need user review. A manually approved scoped rule remains a user decision, and the opt-in marker and every learned rule stay in the project's own `.claude/settings.local.json`, never a user or global setting.

The skill ranks findings in this order: a missing measurement, manual work, existing capabilities that underperform, knowledge being re-derived, then setup friction. It first checks whether an existing project capability can meet the goal or be improved, and only proposes a new capability when the evidence says the existing choices do not fit. It keeps what works and changes a concrete weakness, never the workspace for novelty. Before it offers a change, it identifies the benefit, smallest approach, and boundary; focused research is only for an unknown that could change that call. It never starts a resupply pass without current or standing approval. It proposes at most seven findings one at a time with evidence and an exact change. A rejected recommendation records the user's own no to a proposal actually shown to them, and it does not return in that project; an accepted one is checked in a later pass. A finding the skill itself decides to skip, rather than one the user turned down, is left unrecorded or marked deferred instead of rejected.

## How the loop closes

A SessionEnd hook tallies each session locally in one streamed pass. The due check also counts current-project transcript file metadata, without opening content, so active or uncleanly ended sessions refill the window. Once enough unreviewed session activity or friction accumulates, the SessionStart nudge records that an offer is due and a Stop hook holds one real pause open for Claude to offer a focused optimization round. It blocks once per session, ignores its own continuation, and uses a separate 24-hour cross-session offer cooldown. After an accepted resupply, the same 24-hour cooldown can reopen on twice the usual evidence after a four-hour floor. Declining preserves the evidence window, while each consecutive decline doubles the offer backoff until an accepted resupply resets it. Applied recommendations record their targets, and later checks compare the signal before and after. Recommendations still need separate approval unless standing permission covers their exact class.

## What it stores

Tallies and decisions live under `~/.claude/quartermaster-state/`: per-session counters and a decision ledger with fingerprints. The bounded aggregate is the model-facing summary for setup and resupply. Raw transcripts are not loaded into model context, and the resupply skill must not open them. Transcript-derived text in the aggregate is clipped, and scratch directories are dropped from path areas.

The [generated Quartermaster reference](../../reference/quartermaster/) contains the agent-facing skill and command details. See [contributing](../../contributing/) for maintainer workflows and the separate [support page](https://eigenwise.github.io/eigenwise-toolshed/support/) for ways to help.
